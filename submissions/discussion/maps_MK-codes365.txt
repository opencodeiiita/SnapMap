maps_MK-codes365
Issue: #316
Repo: https://github.com/opencodeiiita/SnapMap

Approach:
- Goal: improve location accuracy used on Map screen and provide a path for future features (search, reverse-geocoding).
- Implemented a small abstraction at `frontend/src/utils/location.ts` which:
  - Attempts to use `react-native-geolocation-service` (native fused provider) when the native module is available (preferred for highest accuracy).
  - Falls back to `expo-location` when the app is running in Expo-managed environments or when native module isn't available.
  - Requests appropriate permissions (Android via `PermissionsAndroid`, iOS via `expo-location` request API).
  - Uses high-accuracy calls and small maximumAge / timeout to avoid stale/warm caches.

Files changed / added:
- `frontend/src/screens/MapScreen.tsx` — replaced direct `expo-location` usage with the new helper and added a console log when a location is obtained.
- `frontend/src/utils/location.ts` — NEW: abstraction that prefers `react-native-geolocation-service`, falls back to `expo-location`.
- `frontend/package.json` — added `react-native-geolocation-service` dependency (so native builds can use the native fused provider).
- `submissions/discussion/maps_MK-codes365.txt` — this report file.

Observations and testing instructions (how to verify improved accuracy):
1) Install dependencies and build (native builds recommended for best results):

   # from repository root
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # For Expo-managed (quick test, fallback will be used):
   expo start

   # For native (recommended; react-native-geolocation-service requires native linking):
   expo prebuild --clean
   npx pod-install ios
   expo run:android

2) Compare accuracy behavior
- Before: the app used `expo-location` default calls. Depending on device and cached locations, accuracy could be low (~10-100m or worse) or rely on last known.
- After: when the native `react-native-geolocation-service` is available (native build), the helper calls `getCurrentPosition` with `enableHighAccuracy: true`, `timeout: 15000`, and `maximumAge: 0`. This typically yields better GPS accuracy (single-digit meters) on devices with GPS.

3) How to measure / proof of improvement
- Open the app on device (native build). Visit the Map screen.
- Check device console (Metro or Android Studio Logcat / Xcode console). The Map screen logs the obtained location with accuracy; look for lines like:

  Obtained location: { latitude: 12.345678, longitude: 98.765432, accuracy: 4.2 }

- Compare the `accuracy` value with the previous behaviour (if you have a baseline). Typical expected outcome: `accuracy` reduced (smaller number) when native provider is used (e.g., from 20-50m down to 3-8m).


What I changed in code (brief):
- `MapScreen` now asks for permission via `requestLocationPermission()` and calls `getCurrentLocation()`; if a location is returned it's used; otherwise the app falls back to a default location.
- `location.ts` dynamically tries to require `react-native-geolocation-service`; if it's not present, it uses `expo-location`'s `getCurrentPositionAsync` with `Location.Accuracy.Highest`.
