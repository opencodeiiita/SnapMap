Working on SnapMap was a fun and meaningful experience. It felt like a real project where 
contributions actually mattered. I learned a lot by exploring the codebase, fixing issues, and 
understanding how things connect.

Some parts were tricky at first and took time to figure out, but that challenge made the experience
better. Overall, the repo was well-managed, and contributing here was genuinely rewarding.

Glad I got the chance to contribute. Looking forward to future versions!
